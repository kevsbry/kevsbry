### Hi, I'm Kevin Bryan :wave:

I'm a web developer who has experience in both front-end and back-end development. My expertise is React.js when it comes to front-end development, and I'm currently transitioning from golang to node.js / express to become a MERN stack developer one day.

Skills: React / Redux / TypeScript / JS / HTML / CSS / Sass / Node / Express
